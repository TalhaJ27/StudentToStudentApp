## Overview
### Description
An app where students can join and share tips, tricks, past exams, join discussion boards, keep up to date with campus wide updates and meet study-buddies.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking 
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as Reddit or other similar apps. Functionality would be same across all devices.
- **Story:** Connects Queens College students. The users can post their interests and engage with other with similar interests. In addition students can post resources, tutoring services, and additional help posts.
- **Market:** Current Students enrolled in Queen College. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly theyâ€™re looking for.
- **Scope:** At first we will start as a social app for students enrolled in Queens College, interested in Computer Science. This can evolve into a larger app which includes all CUNY/SUNY students.
